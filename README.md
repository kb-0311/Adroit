# Adroit FinancESG (Starting files)

## Consists of Static Pages only upto now

First and Foremost the code was more of a learning experience for me to brush up on my styling using HTML and CSS (& Frameworks ) only and avoid using Javascript/jquery/EJS/ as much as possible.

To put it simply I had to design something what one might call - Billboard for ESG stocks. 

The projects has two main focus - The " top 100 ESG stocks "page, where a list of top 100 companies is arranged in descending order of the stocks' ESG score.

The "Sectoral Indices" section lays out the top 3 companies according to their indices and ESG score  in each sector like Tech , Auto , Mining , etc .

More elaborate details are in my opinion , appropriately provided within the project itself : ) 

## Branches to add in the future :

1. More industries to add in the Sectoral indices.
2. Expand more on the details of each sector.
3. Style out the top 100 ESG stocks a LOT better than the current one. 
4. design the background elemets of "TEAM" and "Contact US" Page .
5. Handly the form in the contact. 
6. Add in the entry point for node and then set up the routes in a localhost server and send the static files to their respective routes.
